Problem description: The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.

Given two integers x and y, calculate the Hamming distance.

Example:
Input: x = 1, y = 4
Output: 2
Explanation:
1   (0 0 0 1)
4   (0 1 0 0)
       â†‘   â†‘

The above arrows point to positions where the corresponding bits are different.

Intuition behind solution: We need to check the binary representation of x against the binary representation of y.
We are trying to compare the ith bit of x against the ith bit of y for every bit in their respective representations
and find how many places they differ. Because we are trying to find places where they differ, this makes the bitwise
operation XOR a great candidate for helping us create a solution.
 XOR will yield a 1 when the ith bit of x and the ith bit of y differ and a 0 when they are the same.
